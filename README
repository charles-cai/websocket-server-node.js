websocket-server-node.js

A Web Socket server for local use written in JavaScript, using node.js.


1. Get node.js from nodejs.org
2. node server.js
3. Open echo-client.html in a browser that supports the Web Socket protocol


TSL is not supported.

The reason why the server blocks remote addresses other than localhost, is that
I only use it locally myself, and also because I want to keep the code as simple
as possible.

The resources included by default allows the client to do anything that a user
can do from the command line. You would either have to remove resources or
write authentication/authorization code, and remove the remoteAddress-check
to make it usable for other remote addresses.
